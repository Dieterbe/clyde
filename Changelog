* Version 0.3.10 [2011-02-10 Thu]

** AUR Customize Messages

The great big warning has been changed to yellow and now only the arrow
next to it blinks. And there was much rejoicing. A new "Customizing..."
status message was added just to be complete...

** AUR Build Directory is Overridable                                   :NEW:

You can override the build directory now. The build directory is where
source packages are extracted to. Alot of the AUR code was re-written
and moved to the aur.lua file. Keen!

The build directory must exist, clyde will not create it for you.
Thanks to "rekado" on github for the patch that started it all.

** Change Log                                                           :NEW:

I started this change log because I tend to forget what I change. I
wanted a higher-level view of changes than git commit logs give
me. This text file uses org-mode in Emacs.

* Version 0.3.09 [2011-02-04 Fri]

** Transaction Conversation Callbacks                                   :BUG:

Answers would always came back to clyde as a no. :^o
