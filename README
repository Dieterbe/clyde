A note from the lead developer (DigitalKiwi):

In all seriousness: It should be perfectly safe to use, it only lacks a few
features that pacman has (Mainly progress bars). Bugs can be posted to github
or http://bugs.archuser.com/index.php?project=4 or DigitalKiwi on freenode

It is still lacking most of the AUR support that it will have, so if you find
it lacking wait a while and come back and you may be pleasantly surprised.

Thank you for your interest in Clyde, I hope it serves you well, leave
feedback if you like and I will take it into consideraion.
